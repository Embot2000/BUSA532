What I have so far

I have included the first data file I found just in case (`DailyGHCN_2020_to_20201125.csv`) and its associated documentation file. I don't think we will end up using this though because it's a daily file.

Also included is a python script `noaaAPI.py` for fetching an hourly file for DFW airport. I think this will be our best bet. I had to stop for now so I didn't get farther than bringing back the response. This should be a great starting point, though!
